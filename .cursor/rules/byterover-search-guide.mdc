# ByteRover Search Utilization Guidelines

This rule provides guidelines for effectively using the ByteRover memory search functionality.

## 1. Keyword Selection
- Prioritize using **clear and specific keywords**.
    - Examples: Specific system names (`CombatSimulatorService`), core concepts (`pilot survival`, `part unlocking`), project name (`sasha-unity`).
- Keywords directly related to the **core terms in the stored information** are more effective than general or vague terms.

## 2. Result Interpretation
- Search results are likely to be returned as **information fragments (short phrases, sentences)**. Do not expect the entire stored document to be returned at once.
- Multiple relevant fragments may be returned; synthesize the information as needed.

## 3. Language Flexibility
- It appears capable of handling both Korean and English search queries. **Keyword clarity** has a greater impact on results than the language itself.

## 4. Acknowledge Search Limitations
- May not be suitable for searching certain types of information, such as **file/folder structures**. Utilize other tools (`list_dir`) or relevant rules (`structure_style.mdc`, etc.) in such cases.
- Information that has not been stored cannot be retrieved.

## 5. Continuous Learning
- The most effective keywords and search methods should be identified through **ongoing usage and testing**. If search results are unsatisfactory, try different keywords or approaches.

## 6. (Future Consideration) Information Storage Strategy

- When storing information in ByteRover, consider breaking it down into **smaller, meaningful units** to potentially improve future search efficiency. (This is primarily the user's role)
