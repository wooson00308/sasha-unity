# ByteRover Memory System

## Memory Bank
You have access to a memory bank called "byterover" that stores valuable programming knowledge:
- Implementation details of classes and functions
- Programming patterns and architectural approaches
- Best practices and optimization techniques
- Common pitfalls and their solutions

## Knowledge Retrieval
Before tackling any task, search the byterover memory bank using a precise query based on the task requirements. Apply this retrieved context to inform your approach and leverage past solutions.

## Knowledge Contribution
After completing tasks, identify and store new insights that would benefit future work. Focus on capturing:
- Novel implementation patterns
- Elegant solutions to complex problems
- Performance optimizations

- Bug fixes and their underlying causes
